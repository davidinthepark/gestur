# Gestur
Hello and welcome to Gestur!
Gestur is an iOS application which translates hand signs used in American Sign Language to written English, 
with its main goal being a bridge between the deaf/hearing impaired community and the rest of the world!
The application relies on an image processing ML engine based on Microsoft's Custom Vision AI.

## Installation
This application was built natively for iOS via Xcode, therefore you will need MacOS to set up the envirionment.
Once you have some form of MacOS with Xcode installed, you may pull/branch off of this project and go nuts!

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
